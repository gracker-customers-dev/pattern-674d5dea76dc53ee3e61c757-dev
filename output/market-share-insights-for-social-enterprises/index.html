                        <p>Market share is a critical concept for any business, including social enterprises, which aim to generate social or environmental benefits alongside financial return. Understanding market share allows social enterprises to gauge their position within the competitive landscape and strategize for growth and sustainability.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Definition of Market Share</h3>

                            
                        <p>Market share refers to the portion of a market controlled by a particular company or product.
